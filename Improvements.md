### Improvements

These are a list of things that could potentially be improved upon / added in the future:

(This was created on the final day as a collection of ideas thrown around, so it is not comprehensive)

Please add more!

## AI

* Add an AI that chooses the correct gumpifier quote
* Add an AI that chooses the best position to put the person into
* Add an AI that improves upon the auto colour selection
* Improve the segmentation!
* Add shadows

## Rest of the project

* Change to Flask?
* When uploading images, if the user changes images whilst the previous one is uploading then cancel the upload to prevent a chain of uploads for no reason
* Change UI to offer some standard images too so it is easy to try Gumpifier without having to upload your own pictures
* Add a control to switch the Gump quote on/off as erasing the text to remove it is cumbersome and not obvious

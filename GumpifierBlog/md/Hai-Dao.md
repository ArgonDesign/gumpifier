# Hai-Dao -- Dovetailed -- User Experience

## Brief

The goal of the joint project was to use the strengths of Argon Design's software skill and Dovetailed's user experience (UX) expertise to create a fun tool powered by artificial intelligence (AI) informed by UX principles. The idea for the Gumpifier was borne out of an interest in cutting edge AI research and a desire to make AI approachable and human-centered.

## Process

After a joint brainstorm, we at Dovetailed began to research similar AI experiments and tools: Google's [library of fun AI experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai) was a great source of inspiration and fun around the office.  Argon Design provided a proof of concept which gave an idea of how the Gumpifier would function, however, the user interface (UI) of the Gumpifier was far from decided.  Our goal with the Gumpifier was to maintain a simple and playful UI that used familiar patterns and gestures.  The Gumpifier is a fun tool that shouldn't require a steep learning curve or loads of text to use. 

We went through four iterations of the Gumpifier, using internal feedback for the initial designs and testing with real users for the final two iterations.

Figures 1 through 3 show the biggest change in visual design - this is when the concept of the Gumpifier was still in flux.  We experimented with different functions and interaction patterns in order to achieve an optimal tool.  Prototypes were evaluated on ease of understanding, efficiency in achieving the goal task, and visual playfulness.  I defined 'playful' in this use case as something that elicited a giggle or a smile, whether through allusions to Forrest Gump or fun colours that added brightness to the tool.  If our users were able to understand the goal of the tool, effectively utilize the Gumpifer to manipulate images and have fun while doing it, that was the golden standard of a user-centered process.

Figure 4 is the closest to the design that you see today on the Gumpifer website - selection patterns and button placements have changed but the key features of the Gumpifier (moving, editing and saving) are all present. 

Interactive prototypes were especially helpful for testing, as whiteboard sketches don't have quite the same functions digital products do.  Once we began testing with digital prototypes it was important to test for any confusion traps by allowing users to make their own judgments of how the Gumpifer would function and accommodating for those uses with the next design iteration.  With more testing and time away from the project, I think the next iteration could focus on refining visual elements and having more user input on the AI side (for example, by allowing users to select which elements of an image are part of the foreground or background).  Even after the launch of the Gumpifier, we are still looking for user feedback and would love to hear what you have to say! 

## User Experience of AI

AI is a hot topic that can garner reactions both positive and negative.  Rather than the dystopian view of AI as a tool to replace people and eliminate humanity, we believe in a user-centered AI that empowers human flourishing by automating the boring stuff and giving people time to solve the larger issues.  In the field of AI ethics, AI that cannot be explained is known as *black-box AI*.  Black-box AI gives us answers without being able to trace how or why it made the decision it did.

*User-centered AI*  is AI that is explainable and seeks to enhance rather than replace humans.  During the initial brainstorm for the Gumpifier, we sought to create something that used AI techniques without eliminating user control.  The Gumpifier depends on you for photo choices and allows users to edit the Gumpified image to whatever parameters they wish.  The Gumpifier is merely an assistant, making the process of editing people in and out of photos much quicker and simpler.  We have also included an explanation of what the Gumpifier does when it processes photos to keep users in the loop.  In the future, tools that could help unite UX and AI development must be collaborative and creative in nature - maybe a design tool like Sketch that could link to dev tools like Sublime Text in order to demonstrate what AI tools are like to both designers and developers.  True user-centered AI is about thinking about the needs of users from the very beginning of a project and ensuring that humans are the ones who will benefit most from your use of AI.
